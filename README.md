Work SmaRTTer, not harder.

This extension aims to help users of the RTT time tracking software to have additional information about how much work they have already done and how much is left to be completed before the end of the month.

After installation the new tab page will be replaced to match the extension's popup, which will contain all the information necessary to get the extension set up with the RTT time tracking software. Once setup is completed the popup and new tab page will display statistics about the total hours worked today and in the current month.

The settings allow for adjusting the work hours per day, the interval at which time data is synchronized with the backend, and a static field to subtract working days from the current month due to holidays.
